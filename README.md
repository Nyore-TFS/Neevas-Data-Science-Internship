# Project Overview.
In the course of this Data Science internship, I created all 5 tasks uploaded on here as my project work. These tasks helped in improving my Data Science and Data Analytical skills such as working on Data Cleaning and Data Visualaization, Creating Predictive Models using Linear Regresssion and
also creating Time Serires Analysis using Python's ARIMA model in order to craete future forecast and model testing.

# Data Sources.
Data used for these projects were gotten from:
- Python's yfinance library which was used for the Predictive Model (Task 3) and Time series analysis (Task 4).
- Data from State of Illinois Data Portal on Building Permits was used for Task 1 and Task 2. [Download Link](https://data.illinois.gov/dataset/city-of-rockford-building-permits).
- HR dataset from Kaggle on Job Applications was used for Task 5. [Download Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushtankha/70k-job-applicants-data-human-resource).
